     Despite the taunting wiggle of the King of Hell’s gloved finger, the radio demon kept a firm and collected gaze on him. Any sort of jeers the leader of Hell threw cannot possibly phase Alastor. The radio demon was intrigued nonetheless. Pausing briefly, Alastor took his cane and placed the middle of the base into Lucifer’s hand. Holding his cane together with Lucifer, the demon curtseyed while his left arm extended outward to his side.

    <p>
     “Try and keep up now.” Alastor sang almost threateningly. His grin widening.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor challenges Lucifer with a threatening tone, showcasing his confidence." type="button">
     Alastor, Lucifer
    </button>
    <p>
     Lucifer looked somewhat confused for a moment upon receiving the base of the radio demon’s cane instead of his hand, but his thoughts were interrupted when the demon abruptly moved with the music. Lucifer was forced to keep up, circling his fingers around the base of the cane with Alastor’s right hand above his. The two circle each other within the beat of the classical violin tune coming from the record player.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary location" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Hell" type="button">

    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer and Alastor dance a waltz together, both trying to take the lead in the dance." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     They stare at one another in tandem with the music.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sway of the stringed instruments brought them closer until their chests were almost touching, then apart. Closer, then apart in repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer figured quickly the radio demon was avoiding physical touch. With that, he allowed the demon to take the lead. Despite the nontraditional usage of a cane in a waltz, their dance was quite enjoyable.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary character" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="character: Tall, rigid form for formal ballroom dancing, height difference with the demon, cheeks dusted red, gets flustered, eyes met with Alastor's, genuinely enjoyed the engaging dance with Alastor" type="button">
     Lucifer
    </button>
    <p>
     Alastor snaked his left hand to Lucifer’s own cane that he held, avoiding his touch but still feathering his fingers close to the man’s arm as he took hold of the stick with Lucifer. Their dance now resembles a waltz.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary character" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="character: Wears a menacing grin, static laughter, taller than Lucifer, takes the lead in dancing, takes back the lead, pulls Lucifer in different directions, speaks in a hushed voice against Lucifer's ear, makes Lucifer twirl, makes Lucifer dip and twirl, finds amusement in Lucifer's reactions, shows zero fear in pushing Lucifer's buttons" type="button">
     Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     Alastor’s actions took Lucifer off guard. He almost tumbled over his own two feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tsk, tsk. Keep up, keep up,” The demon teased.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor teases Lucifer about his formal ballroom dancing form and gives him a nickname, 'little apple'. Lucifer tries to take the lead in the dance but Alastor counters and takes the lead back." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     “Your form is rather rigid for formal ballroom dancing, little apple.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer jeered as they swayed with the sounds of the violin filling his room. “Hey-! Don’t call me th–!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their height difference made the waltz awkward. Lucifer briefly glanced down but he was immediately shot with a, “Look at me, not at your feet, my little apple .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Infuriated, Lucifer fought to take the lead. He swayed in the opposite direction, swiftly pulling the demon to mimic his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do not recall allowing you to address me by such a nickname.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their gaze met, both unwavering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hahaha~! My deer little apple, we do not get to choose our own nicknames,” Alastor countered.
    </p>
    <p>
     His menacing grin stretched. Amused, Alastor took the opportunity to take back the lead while Lucifer was still caught off guard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer almost tripped when Alastor pulled him the opposite direction of where he swayed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King used his strength to try and regain the lead.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer and Alastor battle to take charge in the dance, showcasing their strength and power." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     Both battled to take charge. The King of Hell and an Overlord. Their dance was completely unsynchronized, each seeming to take part in the shifting change of tone and instruments in the waltz. As unmatched as they were in nearly every aspect, they danced perfectly to the waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor quickly pulled the shorter male’s arm upwards, causing Lucifer to twirl his back inches away from the radio demon’s chest. Once again, caught off guard, Lucifer’s lead over the dance dissipated. Alastor’s static laughter ringed in his ears.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor twirls Lucifer during the dance and continues to take the lead, causing Lucifer to enjoy the interactions." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     ”Are you trying to spar with me during our dance, little apple? Shouldn’t you let the bigger demon lead?” He spoke in a hushed voice against Lucifer’s ear. His radio voice faded into a hum that followed the beat of the record. The King jumped a little, cheeks dusted red. Alastor untwists Lucifer outwards and resumes their waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer should be irritated, but he found himself enjoying the push and pull of the demon’s motions.
    </p>
    <p>
     He chuckled along with the demon.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You infuriate me, Alastor.”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor continues to tease and provoke Lucifer during the dance, enjoying his reactions." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     “Hmmm..~” Alastor hummed in response. “I would be hurt, but that is not quite true currently… is it now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Unexpectedly, a hand clasp around the King’s, then around his other one as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Puzzled, Lucifer blinked a few times. Alastor’s cane was nowhere in sight. The demon probably made it disappear as he is now holding Lucifer in the proper tradition for a waltz. Alastor did not allow Lucifer to have time to adjust as he spun with the tune of the stringed music flooding the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     The shorter male followed on beat with Alastor’s movements. They sway along with each other harmoniously. He felt himself getting flustered as he tried to compose himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer did NOT want Alastor to find amusement in any of his obvious reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor was soaking in all of Lucifer’s obvious reactions and finding amusement in them.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the canes gone, it was much easier to dip and twirl the shorter as Alastor pleased. This action caused his companion to get even more befuddled. Lucifer’s eyes met with Alastor’s once more. Despite himself, Lucifer genuinely enjoyed the engaging dance with Alastor. The demon pushed his buttons (on purpose), and showed zero fear doing so.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor takes control of the dance, causing Lucifer to be flustered and amused by their engaging dance." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     They spun around each other, arms and hands meeting as they faced each other once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The music soon died down and Lucifer found himself a little disappointed that their dance ended so soon. Maybe he was just lonely. Being alone in his estate for several years after his wife left has taken a toll on him.

     Alastor released the King and gave him a polite bow.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary character" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="character: Releasing the King and giving a polite bow, straightening himself up after being offered a rubber duck named Sir Pipperson" type="button">
     Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     Lucifer rubbed the back of his neck. He returned the same gesture. He craned his neck to look at anywhere but the radio demon who was straightening himself up. “Oh! Wait!” Lucifer took one of his many favorite rubber ducks on the dresser. He scurried back to the demon, offering the awesome fantastical whimsical Sir Pipperson to the demon.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer offering Sir Pipperson to Alastor" type="button">

    </button>
    <p>
     “Since you nabbed one of my treasures, I assume you’d like another one. This one’s name is Sir Pipperson!” Lucifer shook his duck enthusiastically before the radio demon.
    </p>
    <p>
     “One of his kinds! Uhh… one of his many kinds, I mean…! He can breathe fire.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor’s eyes crinkled at the trinket.
    </p>
