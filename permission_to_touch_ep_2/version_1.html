     Despite the taunting wiggle of the King of Hell’s gloved finger, the radio demon kept a firm and collected gaze on him. Any sort of jeers the leader of Hell threw cannot possibly phase Alastor. The radio demon was intrigued nonetheless. Pausing briefly, Alastor took his cane and placed the middle of the base into Lucifer’s hand. Holding his cane together with Lucifer, the demon curtseyed while his left arm extended outward to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Try and keep up now.” Alastor sang almost threateningly. His grin widening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer looked somewhat confused for a moment upon receiving the base of the radio demon’s cane instead of his hand, but his thoughts were interrupted when the demon abruptly moved with the music. Lucifer was forced to keep up, circling his fingers around the base of the cane with Alastor’s right hand above his. The two circle each other within the beat of the classical violin tune coming from the record player.

     They stare at one another in tandem with the music.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sway of the stringed instruments brought them closer until their chests were almost touching, then apart. Closer, then apart in repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer figured quickly the radio demon was avoiding physical touch. With that, he allowed the demon to take the lead. Despite the nontraditional usage of a cane in a waltz, their dance was quite enjoyable.
    </p>

    </button>
    <p>
     Alastor snaked his left hand to Lucifer’s own cane that he held, avoiding his touch but still feathering his fingers close to the man’s arm as he took hold of the stick with Lucifer. Their dance now resembles a waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor’s actions took Lucifer off guard. He almost tumbled over his own two feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tsk, tsk. Keep up, keep up,” The demon teased.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor challenges Lucifer during the dance, leading to a playful exchange." type="button">

     Lucifer jeered as they swayed with the sounds of the violin filling his room. “Hey-! Don’t call me th–!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their height difference made the waltz awkward. Lucifer briefly glanced down but he was immediately shot with a, “Look at me, not at your feet, my little apple .”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary novelty" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="novelty item: Their height difference made the waltz awkward" type="button">

    <p>
     Infuriated, Lucifer fought to take the lead. He swayed in the opposite direction, swiftly pulling the demon to mimic his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do not recall allowing you to address me by such a nickname.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their gaze met, both unwavering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hahaha~! My deer little apple, we do not get to choose our own nicknames,” Alastor countered.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary novelty" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="novelty item: Alastor's menacing grin stretched" type="button">
     menacing grin stretched
    </button>
    <p>
     His menacing grin stretched. Amused, Alastor took the opportunity to take back the lead while Lucifer was still caught off guard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer almost tripped when Alastor pulled him the opposite direction of where he swayed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King used his strength to try and regain the lead.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer and Alastor continue their dance, with both trying to take the lead." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     Both battled to take charge. The King of Hell and an Overlord. Their dance was completely unsynchronized, each seeming to take part in the shifting change of tone and instruments in the waltz. As unmatched as they were in nearly every aspect, they danced perfectly to the waltz.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary novelty" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="novelty item: Their dance was completely unsynchronized" type="button">
     unsynchronized dance
    </button>
    <p>
     Alastor quickly pulled the shorter male’s arm upwards, causing Lucifer to twirl his back inches away from the radio demon’s chest. Once again, caught off guard, Lucifer’s lead over the dance dissipated. Alastor’s static laughter ringed in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”Are you trying to spar with me during our dance, little apple? Shouldn’t you let the bigger demon lead?” He spoke in a hushed voice against Lucifer’s ear. His radio voice faded into a hum that followed the beat of the record. The King jumped a little, cheeks dusted red. Alastor untwists Lucifer outwards and resumes their waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer should be irritated, but he found himself enjoying the push and pull of the demon’s motions.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor surprises Lucifer with his dance moves, causing Lucifer to enjoy the interaction." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     He chuckled along with the demon.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You infuriate me, Alastor.”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer expresses his frustration while Alastor remains calm and playful." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     “Hmmm..~” Alastor hummed in response. “I would be hurt, but that is not quite true currently… is it now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Unexpectedly, a hand clasp around the King’s, then around his other one as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Puzzled, Lucifer blinked a few times. Alastor’s cane was nowhere in sight. The demon probably made it disappear as he is now holding Lucifer in the proper tradition for a waltz. Alastor did not allow Lucifer to have time to adjust as he spun with the tune of the stringed music flooding the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     The shorter male followed on beat with Alastor’s movements. They sway along with each other harmoniously. He felt himself getting flustered as he tried to compose himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer did NOT want Alastor to find amusement in any of his obvious reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor was soaking in all of Lucifer’s obvious reactions and finding amusement in them.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the canes gone, it was much easier to dip and twirl the shorter as Alastor pleased. This action caused his companion to get even more befuddled. Lucifer’s eyes met with Alastor’s once more. Despite himself, Lucifer genuinely enjoyed the engaging dance with Alastor. The demon pushed his buttons (on purpose), and showed zero fear doing so.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor and Lucifer share a moment of amusement and connection during the dance." type="button">

    </button>
    <p>
     They spun around each other, arms and hands meeting as they faced each other once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The music soon died down and Lucifer found himself a little disappointed that their dance ended so soon. Maybe he was just lonely. Being alone in his estate for several years after his wife left has taken a toll on him.

    <p>
     Lucifer rubbed the back of his neck. He returned the same gesture. He craned his neck to look at anywhere but the radio demon who was straightening himself up. “Oh! Wait!” Lucifer took one of his many favorite rubber ducks on the dresser. He scurried back to the demon, offering the awesome fantastical whimsical Sir Pipperson to the demon.
