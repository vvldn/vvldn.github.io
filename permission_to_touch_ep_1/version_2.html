     Moving his things took no time for the King of Hell himself. With a snap of his fingers, Lucifer manifested furniture fit for a King. He had a few sentimental items brought to the hotel, but the majority of his belongings remained at his estate. One thing Lucifer made sure to add to his room was a little workshop at the corner of his room for his whimsical rubber duck creations.

     On the other side of the building, Alastor decided it was time to pay a visit to the head of Hell himself. The time that the little apple has been here has been quite entertaining. Seeing as they have gotten off on the ‘wrong foot’, Alastor thought a nice welcoming gift and a few taunting words would be a great welcome!

    <p>
     The King quickly answered the door with full expectation for it to be Charlie. His large smile faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahh… this guy… His smile dropped to a visible frown.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want?” Lucifer leaned against the door frame. The King was wearing more casual attire for his move. The top hat and coat were both gone from the shorter male’s frame.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer asks Alastor what he wants and Alastor mentions being the facility manager of Lucifer's daughter's hotel" type="button">

    <p>
     Alastor’s eyes narrow slightly at the immediate change in demeanor. He kept the same charming smile as he always wore. He brought the top of his cane to the apple of Lucifer’s cheek, giving it a tap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that any way to greet the facility manager of your daughter’s lovely hotel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer fought the urge to smite the radio demon right then and there. How DARE he toy with him so carefreely! Just as his anger rose, the demon melted into a black pit on the floor and appeared inside the room behind Lucifer a second later.

     “I’m merely here to officially welcome our newest member of the hotel,” Alastor explained as his eyes wandered around the room in observation.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary character" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="character: Alastor is described as composed and mocking, with a smile that stretches further and a teethy chuckle. He is seen twiddling his fingertips on top of his cane." type="button">

    <p>
     So that’s how he wants to play it, Lucifer thought. “Riiiiiight….” He expressed a sigh and shut the door behind him. “I don’t believe that. You’re here just for kicks, aren’t cha?” He crossed his arms as he leered up at the radio demon. “I figured you enjoy seeing me worked up.”
    </p>

    </button>
    <p>
     “What makes you think that?” Alastor feigns innocence, mockingly gasping as he cocked his head to the side. The corners of his smile seemingly stretched further. “Of course not. As you are staying here from further on, it is only fitting that I change my tune.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He set both hands on top of his cane, his fingertips twiddled on top. “After all, someone has to be the bigger person here for Charlie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer bristled. Was that a stab at both his maturity AND height!?
    </p>
    <p>
     “LISTEN HERE…!” His eyes flashed red momentarily, but he immediately forced back his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     5…4…3…2…1… Lucifer counted down in the back of his head, calming himself. “Don’t let him get to you Lucifer. That’s what he wants,” he mumbled under his breath before peering back up at the demon. “Ha. I don’t believe that for a second. Don’t play me for a fool,” Lucifer turned his nose up as he slowly circled around the demon, scrutinizing him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer materialized his cane into his hand and stopped right in front of the overlord. He pushed the apple of his cane right under Alastor’s chin.
    </p>

    </button>
    <p>
     Alastor remained composed. He was a little impressed that even without Lucifer’s beloved daughter here to witness the two of them, Lucifer behaved so well. There was a brief pause with the apple under his chin. With a tense, teethy chuckle, he knocked the apple cane to the side with his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wonderful! I see the hotel is already having a positive impact on you! You are oh so deserving of this welcome gift!”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: The radio demon praises Lucifer for his behavior and acknowledges the positive impact of the hotel on him." type="button">

     Alastor took a quick glance around the room before he found an end table. He snapped a finger and a black hole sucked up the contents on the table and replaced it with a red gift box with a black ribbon tying it together.

    <p>
     “I– …did you just nab Mr. Duke?!” One of his favorite duckies! Lucifer walked up and cautiously eyed the demon. “If you wanted one, you could’ve just asked,” he huffed, clearly irritated. He turned his attention to the gift and stared at it as if it were something meant to be deceptive.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor gives Lucifer a gift and they discuss trust and music preferences." type="button">
     Alastor, Lucifer
    </button>
    <p>
     “...You open it for me.” Lucifer used his cane to point at Alastor then back at the gift.
    </p>
    <p>
     Amusement flashed in the demon’s eyes at the little duck’s name, even further from the demand he received. Lucifer made it so hard to not mess with him. Alastor shook his head. His cane reached out to point at the present, mimicking Lucifer. “Oh dear me, are you saying you do not trust me enough to open a simple gift? Surely, the King of Hell should have nothing to fear.”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary character" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="character: demon with amusement in his eyes, smiling crinkled eyes, charismatic tone, holding a cane, wearing clothing suited for the King of Hell" type="button">
     Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     The cane tapped on the top of the present. In response, the present shook and a broken noise that resembled the voice of a creature coming from within. “Charlie trusts me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Slightly startled by the strangled noise coming from the box, Lucifer leaned back in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one has ever dared to play with the King of Hell in such a way… Especially not some halfwit overlord! Irritation bubbled up within him. Stay calm, stay calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t trust you…you…strawberry fuck–” He cleared his throat. “Stop bringing up my daughter. I get it. I gotta play along with your games but don’t think for a second that I will let my guard down.” Lucifer begrudgingly opened the gift.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary character" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="character: King of Hell, tense features evaporated, tapping foot to music, offering a hand for a dance, eyes glinting at a challenge" type="button">

    </button>
    <p>
     The tenseness in his features evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
     An old fashioned record player? His mind spiraled at this sort of considerate gift. It was almost as if Alastor paid attention to things his family enjoyed. Charlie loved singing, and Lucifer played many instruments. The demon knew the Morningstars were music enjoyers. “I… this is a nice gift, Alastor.” The faintest of smiles was given to the demon.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary novelty" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="novelty item: An old fashioned record player" type="button">

    </button>
    <p>
     The corner of Alastor’s eyes crinkled. Seeing the emotions playing through Lucifer was interesting, and very close to entertainment in itself. It was rare to see such a display directed towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah yes, and don’t think I did not include any records either. What tunes do you like? Jazz, Blues?” Stepping towards the record player he manifested different vinyls with each suggestion. He folded the disks together before separating them like a deck of cards as he brought out new selections.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary novelty" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="novelty item: manifested different vinyls with each suggestion" type="button">

    <p>
     “You take me as someone who is into the classicals,” Alastor commented.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps his daughter was right and he had to give some benefit of the doubt to some demons. “I’m not picky, but you are right. I enjoy classicals.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer took the needle of the record player down on the vinyl disk.
    </p>

     Dmitri Shostakovich, Waltz No. 2
    </button>
    <p>
     A familiar tune started playing. Lucifer tapped his foot to the music and thought to himself that this is music you dance to with a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hah. To hell with it. That was his final thought before he offered a hand to the man. His other arm folded behind him with his cane as he gave a curt bow with a wry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s no way you gave me this song and not care for a dance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor’s attention immediately snapped back to be met with another rare sight. A few keys of the piano from the record played on as he stared in silence at the welcoming hand. Something seems to break in his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hahaha… you’re inviting me to dance?” The demon's features seemed to tense at the offer but he kept his charismatic tone. The King of Hell dancing alone in his room with a demon overlord. What a humorous thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you certain you want to dance with me? I am not sure you could keep up with me.”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: They banter about dancing and challenge each other." type="button">
     Alastor, Lucifer
    </button>
    <p>
     Lucifer’s eyes glint at the challenge the demon presented. He found it laughable that some nobody overlord could be so gutsy to challenge him as if they were on equal footing. No. Alastor probably thought he was better.
    </p>
    <p>
     As irritating as his companion can be, Alastor brought something entirely different to the table. Something new. It was quite refreshing to hear someone in Hell would dare to fearlessly challenge him in such a way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ha! Me? Unable to keep up?” Lucifer sports a coy grin as he chuckles, bemused.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Try me, deer.” Lucifer taunted with his ring finger.
