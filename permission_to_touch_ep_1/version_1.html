     Moving his things took no time for the King of Hell himself. With a snap of his fingers, Lucifer manifested furniture fit for a King. He had a few sentimental items brought to the hotel, but the majority of his belongings remained at his estate. One thing Lucifer made sure to add to his room was a little workshop at the corner of his room for his whimsical rubber duck creations.

     On the other side of the building, Alastor decided it was time to pay a visit to the head of Hell himself. The time that the little apple has been here has been quite entertaining. Seeing as they have gotten off on the ‘wrong foot’, Alastor thought a nice welcoming gift and a few taunting words would be a great welcome!

     Ahh… this guy… His smile dropped to a visible frown.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want?” Lucifer leaned against the door frame. The King was wearing more casual attire for his move. The top hat and coat were both gone from the shorter male’s frame.

     “Is that any way to greet the facility manager of your daughter’s lovely hotel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer fought the urge to smite the radio demon right then and there. How DARE he toy with him so carefreely! Just as his anger rose, the demon melted into a black pit on the floor and appeared inside the room behind Lucifer a second later.

    </button>
    <p>
     “I’m merely here to officially welcome our newest member of the hotel,” Alastor explained as his eyes wandered around the room in observation.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor welcomed Lucifer to the hotel and they exchanged sarcastic remarks." type="button">

     Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     So that’s how he wants to play it, Lucifer thought. “Riiiiiight….” He expressed a sigh and shut the door behind him. “I don’t believe that. You’re here just for kicks, aren’t cha?” He crossed his arms as he leered up at the radio demon. “I figured you enjoy seeing me worked up.”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer expressed distrust towards Alastor and they discussed their behavior for Charlie." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     “What makes you think that?” Alastor feigns innocence, mockingly gasping as he cocked his head to the side. The corners of his smile seemingly stretched further. “Of course not. As you are staying here from further on, it is only fitting that I change my tune.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He set both hands on top of his cane, his fingertips twiddled on top. “After all, someone has to be the bigger person here for Charlie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer bristled. Was that a stab at both his maturity AND height!?
    </p>
    <p>
     “LISTEN HERE…!” His eyes flashed red momentarily, but he immediately forced back his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     5…4…3…2…1… Lucifer counted down in the back of his head, calming himself. “Don’t let him get to you Lucifer. That’s what he wants,” he mumbled under his breath before peering back up at the demon. “Ha. I don’t believe that for a second. Don’t play me for a fool,” Lucifer turned his nose up as he slowly circled around the demon, scrutinizing him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer materialized his cane into his hand and stopped right in front of the overlord. He pushed the apple of his cane right under Alastor’s chin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But for Charlie… I suppose I can… tolerate you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor remained composed. He was a little impressed that even without Lucifer’s beloved daughter here to witness the two of them, Lucifer behaved so well. There was a brief pause with the apple under his chin. With a tense, teethy chuckle, he knocked the apple cane to the side with his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wonderful! I see the hotel is already having a positive impact on you! You are oh so deserving of this welcome gift!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alastor took a quick glance around the room before he found an end table. He snapped a finger and a black hole sucked up the contents on the table and replaced it with a red gift box with a black ribbon tying it together.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor offered a gift to Lucifer and they had a tense moment while opening it." type="button">

    </button>
    <p>
     “I– …did you just nab Mr. Duke?!” One of his favorite duckies! Lucifer walked up and cautiously eyed the demon. “If you wanted one, you could’ve just asked,” he huffed, clearly irritated. He turned his attention to the gift and stared at it as if it were something meant to be deceptive.
    </p>
    <p>
     “...You open it for me.” Lucifer used his cane to point at Alastor then back at the gift.
    </p>
    <p>
     Amusement flashed in the demon’s eyes at the little duck’s name, even further from the demand he received. Lucifer made it so hard to not mess with him. Alastor shook his head. His cane reached out to point at the present, mimicking Lucifer. “Oh dear me, are you saying you do not trust me enough to open a simple gift? Surely, the King of Hell should have nothing to fear.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The cane tapped on the top of the present. In response, the present shook and a broken noise that resembled the voice of a creature coming from within. “Charlie trusts me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Slightly startled by the strangled noise coming from the box, Lucifer leaned back in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one has ever dared to play with the King of Hell in such a way… Especially not some halfwit overlord! Irritation bubbled up within him. Stay calm, stay calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t trust you…you…strawberry fuck–” He cleared his throat. “Stop bringing up my daughter. I get it. I gotta play along with your games but don’t think for a second that I will let my guard down.” Lucifer begrudgingly opened the gift.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tenseness in his features evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
     An old fashioned record player? His mind spiraled at this sort of considerate gift. It was almost as if Alastor paid attention to things his family enjoyed. Charlie loved singing, and Lucifer played many instruments. The demon knew the Morningstars were music enjoyers. “I… this is a nice gift, Alastor.” The faintest of smiles was given to the demon.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Alastor gave Lucifer a record player and they discussed music preferences." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor

    <button class="btn btn-secondary novelty" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="novelty item: an old fashioned record player" type="button">
     old fashioned record player
    </button>
    <p>
     The corner of Alastor’s eyes crinkled. Seeing the emotions playing through Lucifer was interesting, and very close to entertainment in itself. It was rare to see such a display directed towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah yes, and don’t think I did not include any records either. What tunes do you like? Jazz, Blues?” Stepping towards the record player he manifested different vinyls with each suggestion. He folded the disks together before separating them like a deck of cards as he brought out new selections.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You take me as someone who is into the classicals,” Alastor commented.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps his daughter was right and he had to give some benefit of the doubt to some demons. “I’m not picky, but you are right. I enjoy classicals.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer took the needle of the record player down on the vinyl disk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dmitri Shostakovich, Waltz No. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     A familiar tune started playing. Lucifer tapped his foot to the music and thought to himself that this is music you dance to with a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hah. To hell with it. That was his final thought before he offered a hand to the man. His other arm folded behind him with his cane as he gave a curt bow with a wry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s no way you gave me this song and not care for a dance.”
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary interaction" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="interaction: Lucifer invited Alastor to dance and they exchanged playful banter." type="button">
     Lucifer, Alastor
    </button>
    <p>
     Alastor’s attention immediately snapped back to be met with another rare sight. A few keys of the piano from the record played on as he stared in silence at the welcoming hand. Something seems to break in his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hahaha… you’re inviting me to dance?” The demon's features seemed to tense at the offer but he kept his charismatic tone. The King of Hell dancing alone in his room with a demon overlord. What a humorous thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you certain you want to dance with me? I am not sure you could keep up with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucifer’s eyes glint at the challenge the demon presented. He found it laughable that some nobody overlord could be so gutsy to challenge him as if they were on equal footing. No. Alastor probably thought he was better.
    </p>
    <p>
     As irritating as his companion can be, Alastor brought something entirely different to the table. Something new. It was quite refreshing to hear someone in Hell would dare to fearlessly challenge him in such a way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ha! Me? Unable to keep up?” Lucifer sports a coy grin as he chuckles, bemused.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Try me, deer.” Lucifer taunted with his ring finger.
